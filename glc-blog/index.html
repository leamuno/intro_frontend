      <h3>Grass Deck</h3>
      <h4>Rillaboom/Venusaur</h4>

      <p>The insane thing about Grass is that there is a synergy  between power and consistency within its evolution lines. Over half of your basics have Pokemon seaching attacks and once you get Grotle online, the whole deck can set itself up. Roserade jives really well with the Grotle engine, making it so that you can turn your Pokémon search into anything-search by utilizing Roserade‘s Le Parfum Ability. Since you used your basic Pokemon’s attacks to get set up, they are now powered up and can take big OHKOs with Torterra and Zarude.</p>
