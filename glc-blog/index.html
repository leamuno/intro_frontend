      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Leandro Munoz. I am working on creating an online simulator for 
        the GLC format.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start, I will make an up to date post of competitive decks f or each 
        energy type.

        <h3 class="energy-type">Grass Deck</h3>
        <h4 class="deck-name">Rillaboom/Venusaur</h4>

        <p>
          The insane thing about Grass is that there is a synergy  between power and 
          consistency within its evolution lines. Over half of your basics have Pokemon 
          seaching attacks and once you get Grotle online, the whole deck can set itself up. 
          Roserade jives really well with the Grotle engine, making it so that you can turn 
          your Pokémon search into anything-search by utilizing Roserade&#39;s Le Parfum 
          Ability. Since you used your basic Pokemon&#39;s attacks to get set up, they are 
          now powered up and can take big OHKOs with Torterra and Zarude.

        <h3 class="energy-type">Fire Deck</h3>
        <h4 class="deck-name">Charizard/Heatmor</h4>
        <img 
          src="assets/images/Charizard-Heatmor.png" 
          alt="Charizard-Heatmor Deck List"
          class="deck-image"
        />
        <p>
          With all the best Fire support Pokémon packed into one deck, you&#39;re sure to 
          get set up at a blazing speed! Once Charizard hits the field, its Burn Brightly 
          ability will double the effectiveness of all your energy. Salazzle, and Magcargo 
          support the deck by searching out and drawing you cards turn after turn. Accelerate 
          energy with Welder and Blacksmith to power up Heatmor&#39;s huge Exciting Flames 
          with ease!

        <h3 class="energy-type">Water Deck</h3>
        <h4 class="deck-name">Rain Dance</h4>
        <img 
          src="assets/images/raindance.png" 
          alt="Rain-Dance Deck List"
          class="deck-image"
        />
        <p>
          This deck aims to power up Water&#39;s biggest attackers as fast and consistently 
          as possible with Frosmoth or Baxcalibur. In my mind, this is the “quintessential” 
          Water deck, and one of my favorite decks to pilot in Gym Leader Challenge.

        <h3 class="energy-type">Lightning Deck</h3>
        <h4 class="deck-name">Special Energy</h4>
        <img 
          src="assets/images/Special+Energy.png" 
          alt="Special-Energy Deck List"
          class="deck-image"
        />
        <p>
          This list embodies all the most powerful qualities of Lightning Pokémon in Gym 
          Leader Challenge. Quick aggro with Tapu Koko and Zapdos combined with the mid-late 
          game potential of Amazing Rare Raikou and Regieleki make this deck a monster to 
          deal with on the battle field.

        <h3 class="energy-type">Psychic Deck</h3>
        <h4 class="deck-name">Dragapult</h4>
        <img 
          src="assets/images/Dragapult.png"

        <p>
          There are many different routes to take when building a Psychic type Gym Leader 
          Challenge deck. Selecting which direction to take can be tough! For an archetype 
          that has so much spread and bench damage at its disposal, it has a surprising 
          amount of hard-hitters, too. Gallade is a perfect consistency card, allowing you to 
          search out any supporter you want every turn. Malamar allows you to power up Giratina 
          and Necrozma with ease. Once Dragapult is set up, it can wreak havoc on your opponent 
          with its Infiltrator Ability and awesome Phantom Force attack.
