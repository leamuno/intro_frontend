      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Leandro Munoz. I am working on creating an online simulator for 
        the GLC format.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start, I will make an up to date post of competitive decks f or each 
        energy type.

    <h2>Deck Lists</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Grass Deck</h3>
      <h4>Rillaboom/Venusaur</h4>

      <p>The insane thing about Grass is that there is a synergy  between power and consistency within its evolution lines. Over half of your basics have Pokemon seaching attacks and once you get Grotle online, the whole deck can set itself up. Roserade jives really well with the Grotle engine, making it so that you can turn your Pokémon search into anything-search by utilizing Roserade&#39;s Le Parfum Ability. Since you used your basic Pokemon&#39;s attacks to get set up, they are now powered up and can take big OHKOs with Torterra and Zarude.</p>

      <h3>Fire Deck</h3>
      <h4>Charizard/Heatmor</h4>
      <img src="assets/images/Charizard-Heatmor.png" alt="Charizard-Heatmor Deck List">
      <p>With all the best Fire support Pokémon packed into one deck, you&#39;re sure to get set up at a blazing speed! Once Charizard hits the field, its Burn Brightly ability will double the effectiveness of all your energy. Salazzle, and Magcargo support the deck by searching out and drawing you cards turn after turn. Accelerate energy with Welder and Blacksmith to power up Heatmor&#39;s huge Exciting Flames with ease!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Water Deck</h3>
      <h4>Rain Dance</h4>
      <img src="assets/images/raindance.png" alt="Rain-Dance Deck List">
      <p>This deck aims to power up Water&#39;s biggest attackers as fast and consistently as possible with Frosmoth or Baxcalibur. In my mind, this is the “quintessential” Water deck, and one of my favorite decks to pilot in Gym Leader Challenge.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Lightning Deck</h3>
      <h4>Special Energy</h4>
      <img src="assets/images/Special+Energy.png" alt="Special-Energy Deck List">
      <p>This list embodies all the most powerful qualities of Lightning Pokémon in Gym Leader Challenge. Quick aggro with Tapu Koko and Zapdos combined with the mid-late game potential of Amazing Rare Raikou and Regieleki make this deck a monster to deal with on the battle field.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Psychic Deck</h3>
      <h4>Dragapult</h4>
      <img src="assets/images/Dragapult.png" alt="Dragapult Deck List">
      <p>There are many different routes to take when building a Psychic type Gym Leader Challenge deck. Selecting which direction to take can be tough! For an archetype that has so much spread and bench damage at its disposal, it has a surprising amount of hard-hitters, too. Gallade is a perfect consistency card, allowing you to search out any supporter you want every turn. Malamar allows you to power up Giratina and Necrozma with ease. Once Dragapult is set up, it can wreak havoc on your opponent with its Infiltrator Ability and awesome Phantom Force attack.</p>
